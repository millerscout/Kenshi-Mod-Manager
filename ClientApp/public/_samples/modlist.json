    "description": "Simple mod that gives extra options for how long the Mercenary Contracts last. Bodyguard contracts go up to 7 days now, and outpost guards can last up to 30.\r\n\r\nCost per day stays the same as normal, so it's simply a matter of convenience so you don't have to constantly re-hire them.\r\n\r\nI can make them go as high as you want. So if you want even longer contracts, just ask. Hope you enjoy! :)",

    "description": "This mod expands the Vagrant camps that can be found in the Great Desert. The following features are added by this mod:\r\n\r\nRecruitable Peasants: Talk to a peasant to have a chance of recruiting them. It refreshes every 6 in-game hours, so if it doesn't work the first time you can try again later.\r\n\r\nDealers: Dealers can be found in any vagrant encampment. They sell crude weaponry, drugs, alchohol, and whatever meager scraps of food can be scrounged up. If you're a wanderer who's down on their luck and needs a quick fix or a bite to eat, these would be the people to look out for. They also rarely have some basic resources for construction, though never all that much at once. Also, they can do plastic surgery. Just hope the scalpel is clean.\r\n\r\nMilitiamen: Militiamen are rare vagrants who are a little stronger than normal, and act as the unofficial guards of encampments. They likely won't nearly be enough for serious threats, but if a drifter or some wild animal starts trouble, they'll probably be able to take care of it. They can also heal wounded people, so it might be a smart idea to get on their good side.\r\n\r\nVagrant Cities: While not actual cities, these places are camps of vagrants that are far larger than the normal ones. They don't have anything the smaller encampments don't have, but at the same time there's more stuff in general, and more guards around. If you've gotta lie low somewhere and the cities won't take you, these are probably your best option.\r\n\r\nNew spawn areas: Vagrant camps and cities can now be found in the Skimsands, Hook, the Unwanted Zone, and the Great Desert.",

    "description": "A \"harsher\" version of my Pocket Change mod, adding cats and string of cats to the inventories of practically every NPC in the game. Characters will be holding scraps of loose change compared to the original mod, making it more compatible with any economic overhaul mods or for the sake of reducing one's source of Cats. \"Specialist\" characters like food producers, traders, and diplomats no longer have obscene amounts of money.\r\n\r\nCompared to the original mod characters will hold 45-80% less Cats. For example, The Holy Lord Phoenix had 200k Cats in his inventory using the original mod while in this version he has between 3350 Cats. The varied Samurai and Paladins of the UC and Holy Nation hold anywhere from 100 to 250 Cats, bandits and vagrants in the meagre range of 12-35 Cats.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to have only one of my mods running at a time, so that the inventory changes do not conflict with one another.",

The stats are the same as vanilla with just a hint of Stealth multiplier where applicable.\r\n\r\n[h1]WHAT'S INCLUDED[/h1]\r\n70+ body armor, hats, helmet, mask, pants and boots in mediocre black variant. Covers almost all purchasable armor plus a few clothing as well.\r\n\r\n[h1]IS IT CRAFTABLE?[/h1]\r\nYes. The armors follow same crafting recipe and machine as vanilla ones. Blueprints sold by Rogue Traders.\r\n\r\n[h1]HOW TO GET THE ARMOR/BLUEPRINT[/h1]\r\nAs of Version 3, the armor/blueprints are no longer puchaseable at vanilla shops. They're now sold by Rogue Traders all over the map.\r\n\r\n[h1]WHAT ARE THE ROGUE TRADERS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM[/h1]\r\nRogue Traders are custom traders selling Mediocre Black Armor armor/blueprints. There's at least one of them in most town/village. Major towns can have up to two Rogue Traders in it.\r\n\r\nThey usually hang out at the bar. If the bar is full or there is no bar in the town/village, you'll see them wandering around the place, getting in and out of buildings looking shady AF. They can be pretty hard to spot sometimes because they're wearing all black.\r\n\r\nA word of advice: If you're tempted to attack the Rogue Traders, please don't. They're pretty deadly and they're not quite...human.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]CREDIT[/h1]\r\nVersion 3 includes timor1234's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1710644028]Patch for Fixing Clipping[/url] as part of the mod. Thank you to timor1234 for making the patch and for his permission to include it in this update.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\nAs of Version 3, the patch is part of Mediocre Black Armor. However the patch only covers armor/clothing included in Mediocre Black Armor. You will still need his main [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1678049479]Fixing Clipping Issues{/url] mod if you want to fix overlap/clipping meshes for vanilla armor/clothing.[/quote]",

Say no more!\r\n\r\nThis mod addresses that by introducing a decently sized collection of technologies between tech levels 1 and 5, which can enhance anything ranging from the speed at which you research to the speed at which you produce weapons and armour!\r\n\r\nThe prices of each upgrade is reasonable in my opinion, but feel free to suggest changes. In general, each building can be improved by up to 25% in productivity, with the exception of stone and iron refineries (though this may change) and perhaps something or another I missed.\r\n\r\nThis does not touch any other gameplay features or mechanics. It simply upgrades the productivity of vanilla buildings. \r\n\r\nIf theres something I haven't mentioned that I missed or something weird here or there, let me know. Otherwise, enjoy!",

    "description": "Ever wanted to be able to train up my melee defense in a more realistic way? Want to give yourself a fighting chance early on? Or just want to beat up your freinds?\r\n\r\nWell now you can!\r\n\r\nWith Sparing Mats, you can train your melee defense up to 20!\r\nNEW: Now you there is a seperate sparring mat that you can use to train up your martial arts up to 20!\r\nNOTE: In the build menu it will say that it trains up to level 42, but don't worry, once you build it and click on it, it will say it only trains up to 20. This is because of some sort of bug with the FCS. \r\n\r\nAlso, adds Martial Arts Sparring Mat that trians up to level 10! I don't reccommend using it up to level 10, as I think Martial Arts training should be hard, but people really wanted it, so here it is.\r\n\r\nDue to the limitations of FCS I can't make it require 2 people in order to train a character's melee defense, but I can make it go a lot slower without 2 people. I'll leave it up to you whether you want it to be immersive or not.",

    "description": "This mod is dedicated to filling out the areas left lacking by the dev's world reaction systems. Be it adding effects to locations and factions that got none, or adding more detail to certain vanilla ones.\r\n\r\nNow includes a world state checking character in Waystations to help with debugging issues with world states triggering. As well as a charatcer spawner to find those bugged NPCS, map to it also at Waystation bars.\r\n\r\nNotable effects include:\r\n\r\n-Dust Bandits having a civil war over leadership if the Dust King is taken down. Occupying nearby ruins for their HQs, and starting to have fights in the wilderness with each other. Taking down all the upstart leaders will cause the Dust Bandits to disband entirely.\r\n\r\n-Mongrel and other locations falling to the Fogmen in certain conditions. Your actions have consequences, and sometimes the innocent will suffer due to them regardless of your intentions.\r\n\r\n-The Western Hive going crazy if their Queen is kidnapped. They will be pushed forward by the sole drive of rescuing her, and will not have any mercy if anyone should stand in their way.\r\n\r\n-Rebuilding The Hub under the Shek Kingdom if their forces take either Bad Teeth or Stack from the Holy Nation. Including some dialog to help guide the player on how exactly to advance from stage to stage of the repairs. Plans for rebuilding under the Holy Nation as well, once I get their conquest of the Shek in.\r\n\r\n-Cannibals have been separated into up to 17 warring tribes. As each tribal leader is defeated they are absorbed into one of two larger more powerful tribes. If both large tribes reach full power they will launch a massive war against each other. If all chiefs are defeated, only scattered remnants will be left.\r\n\r\n-The HN's last struggles for survival. After taking out their leaders you will be met regualr raids from the remnants of the HN, who have gathered around some new leaders of their own in hidden locations. There are bread crumbs out in the world to help you track down these new leaders, and until you do the raids will continue to strike you, no matter where you live. Once you wipe out the High Priest and his men though, the Holy Nation will be gone for good.\r\n\r\n-The Shek rebuilding their empire in the event of success in their conflicts. Towns, villages, and outposts sprouting from the ruins in their area, as long as nobody else is around to hinder their work.\r\n\r\n-(Coming Soon(tm)) Rebuilding the faction of Deadcat and reclaiming the Cannibal Plains after they've been cleared from cannibals.\r\n\r\nIf those sound like the kinds of things you'd be interested in, then welcome aboard. Make sure you import when adding to an existing save. Hope you enjoy! :)\r\n\r\n[b]Note: You should probably put this mod as low as possible in the load order, near the bottom of the list to ensure it loads last or close to it. Bugs have been known to occur when loaded before other mods that edit world data, due to the nature of how town locations are stored in the files.[/b]\r\n\r\nprd has made an excellent expansion to this mod, further tweaking and adding world states and effects. You can check it out here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1688854241\r\n\r\nThis mod is NOT compatible with Living World. It touches enough of the same things to break several things, and has been known to trigger some of my overrides when they normally shouldn't. Use both at your own risk!\r\n\r\nRussian Translation:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1671699248\r\n\r\n[i]Image courtesy of Taragoth[/i]\r\n\r\nLooking for a place to discuss Kenshi or Kenshi modding?

    "description": "Make flashier fight by making AI use more varied moves and attack faster.\r\n\r\n- Enabled all weapon moves for all weapon types, including martial art moves for armed combat.\r\n- Changed a lot of attack animation min and max trigger range. They should use more varied moves, but also probably miss more. \r\n- Close range martial art moves like low kick and punches max trigger range reduced for armed combatant so that the character would use their weapon unless they are very close. \r\n- long range attack like heavy down cut or jump kick got their minimum trigger range reduced so that they can be used closer.\r\n- Also changed some move preferences. Combo, left cut, and heavy swing are used more often. Combos are nice looking and effective. Left cut and heavy swing are good CC. And they represent downward swing, left swing, and right swing respectively. Katanas prefers using their combos making them good against single target. Heavies prefers their heavy swings so they work great in group fight.\r\n- Increased all attack animation speed by 10% Faster Attack!\r\n- Increased all defense animation speed by 20% Stronger Defense!\r\n- Increased all stumble animation speed by 30% Faster Recovery! Allowing more chance to turn the table!\r\n- Heavy weapons using light weapons move recieved small damage penalty.\r\n- Light weapon using heavier moves recieved small damage boost. \r\n- Weapon using martial art moves took damage penalty but recieved high speed boost. They have poor AOE, got to compensate with speed.\r\n- Increased max simultaneous hits for every moves, katanas and those smaller weapons should do better in group fight.\r\n- Do note that there are lots of incorrect/weird weapon placement because the mod use animations unintended for those weapons. (Like using heavy moves with katana or vice versa. Or using martial arts with weapons.) I did not make the animations, all animations are from base game.\r\n\r\nCurrent move list arranged by max trigger range:\r\nHeavy Downcut - Charge forward and swing the weapon down hard. Longest range and thus the most common opening move.\r\nFlying Knee - A mid-long range flying knee attack.\r\nJump Kick - jump forward and kick.enemy in medium-long range.\r\nCombo - Press forward with 2 swing combo.\r\nMega Kick - spinning double kicks that looks cool but miss a lot.\r\nHeavy Swing - Full body golf swing from lower left all over to the back right. Sweeping somthing like 270 degree around the user. Mad area attack which left user with huge opening.\r\nDowncut - a simple single downward swing.\r\nLeft cut - pull back the weapon to the waist and make a very short quick cut with the waist.\r\nLeft palm strike - Take a large left step forward and strike with the left palm.\r\nLow Kick - a quick low kick with the left leg.\r\nDouble punches/strikes - very close range one-two combo.\r\n\r\nThere are so many changes in attack animations that this mod probably affect the game balance. If you feel some moves are imbalanced, too weak or too strong, or if there is any change you would like, please leave comments below.\r\n\r\nThanks Woullak and his original mod \"Flying sword\" for the original idea of modding the combat animations. His mod enable martial arts moves for weapons. You can try his mod here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1360386619\r\n\r\nPS.Pardon me for the screenshot quality.

    "description": "Have you recruited all the folks in the bar? Getting tired of checking every bars just for a measly recruit? Don't you wish you can just pay an NPC somewhere to find the recruits and bring them to your base? Well now you can!\r\n\r\nAdventurers Guild introduces a new faction named Adventurers Guild (duh) that will bring recruits straight to your base. You can very easily find their representatives in the bar of almost all major cities, or go to their outpost close to The Hub or their main headquarters in Sinkuun.\r\n\r\n===== HOW DOES IT WORK? =====\r\n\r\nWell I'm glad you asked. When you talk to the representative in any Bar you will be given the option to ask for recruits. You can pick the race of the recruits, and then pay a headhunting fee to them. Few hours after the transaction a squad of adventurers along with your recruits will journey from the guild's outpost or HQ, whichever's the closest. Once they arrive you simply talk to the recruits and hire them individually. All done!\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, this mod also introduces a new outpost named Ishijuku in the south, close to The Hub, and a new small city named Shirokyo in Sinkuun. You can find a bar in both and a robotic store in Shirokyo. These will be the place where the delivery squad spawns.\r\n\r\n===== THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW =====\r\n\r\nThis being a mod, there are a few limitations that you should be aware of to prevent your money being wasted for nothing.\r\n\r\n- IMPORT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Some people that tested the mod claimed it works just fine without importing, but others reported that the NPCs don't appear if they don't import. Because of this I highly recommend to import your game straight away for a smooth experience.\r\n\r\n- Do not ask for multiple same race recruits more than once before the delivery has arrived.\r\nDoing this will overwrite your first delivery, aka wasting your money and time. This is game limitation, so not much can be done about that. Multiple race deliveries are fine tho.\r\n\r\n- Ensure that your base is \"active\".\r\nSomeone must stay in your base for the delivery to execute. If no base is loaded the squad will not spawn and give another go after few days have passed. and YES, FEW DAYS. The re-attempt cooldown is automatically determined, so I can't modify it. You've been warned.\r\n\r\n- Please build your base somewhere survivable.\r\nPlaces like fog islands, deadlands, and black desert are no go zones for Adventurers guild. They will still take your money of course, but they will outright refuse walking in there for obvious reason (they don't want to die). So in case your base is there, I recommend building a small hut somewhere out of those regions to receive the recruits.\r\n\r\n===== CREDITS =====\r\nBig thanks to CATman4L, Shidan, Inflectus, and many more for giving me ideas, guiding me through the nightmare that is FCS, and testing out the mods. Wouldn't have survived without them.",

It requires nothing only the time spent doing the research. The Chitin can also be purchased at the armor shop in Mongrel, armor vendors in the Holy Nation and Hive traders.\r\n\r\n[h1]Other Hiver variants?[/h1]\r\nThere were other variants, but they were causing a lot of issues.

    "description": "Hello Drifters!\r\n\r\nI decided to introduce the quiver to improve a little the archer role in these lands and why not, add a little variety to our play style.\r\nThe Quiver can be equipped in your backpack slot and allows you to store the necessary amount of arrows/bolts to go on a hunt or adventure without running out so fast of bolts.\r\n\r\nFind below the Quiver details. \r\n\r\n[h1]Quiver Stats[/h1]\r\n[list][*][b]Athletics:[/b] +10% (to allow archers more mobility and counterbalance the fact that carrying arrows increase encumbrance which lower running speed).\r\n[*][b]Stealth/Dodge:[/b] -10% (all those arrows clunking around give you away).\r\n[*][b]Combat speed:[/b] +10% (you can reach your arrows faster now that you have them at hand).\r\n[*][b]Storage size:[/b] 2x5 storage. You can stack up to 9 of the same bolt in the quiver.[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]CRAFT / RESEARCH[/h1]\r\n\r\nResearch included in \"Crossbow Bolts\" research. Once you learn that, you will unlock the quiver.\r\nThe Quiver can be crafted in the Arrow Making Bench.\r\n\r\n[h1] Location [/h1]\r\n\r\nThe Quiver may respawn in many vendors that have for sale crossbows, including The Hub's bar. I won't go on detail, find it in your adventure!\r\n\r\n-*-*-*-*-*\r\nEDIT: As per community request and considering balance, Quiver storage stack limit has been increased from 6 stacks to 9 stacks.\r\n\r\n[code]credits: thanks to 3dregenerator for the mesh.

    "description": "Did you know that Kenshi gets quieter as time goes on? That is because so many dialogues are only ever spoken once!\r\n\r\nNow everyone can waste time speaking about the same things over and over again like real life! The Dried Gristle Flaps. The singing. And various other.\r\n\r\nI pretty much just set bunch of dialogue from 'only once' to repeatable every week or so. Bar dialogues also trigger more often.\r\n\r\nTips for having a lively squad:\r\n1. Travel! Many dialogues are triggered by entering new biome, especially strange and unique biomes.\r\n2. Visit bars! That's where people talks.\r\n3. Do stuff! By that I meant do big stuff like hunting legends and carrying them around.\r\n\r\nAnd obviously, unique recruits have unique lines. Following unique recruits are some which I found unique lines in the FCS.\r\n\r\nUniques with many dialogues:\r\n- Agnu the broken soldier bot. Beep's best friend\r\n- Bard the wandering bard? Occasionally sings, or fails to sing.\r\n- Beep BEEP IS THE STRONGEST WARRIOR! found in Mongrel\r\n- Bo the famous anti slaver ninja. Has a special dialogue with anti slaver and has own dialogue package.\r\n- Crumblejon the old man. He was a famous samurai working for UC.\r\n- Digna the Flotsam Ninja who killed her own father to get away from HN.\r\n- Doctor Chung the swamp surgeon. Has lots of dialogues with healing. Doesn't provide surgery service though.\r\n- Ells the rum thief. I've found her quite endearing.\r\n- Espher depressed hiver prisoner of Tengu's Vault.\r\n- Griffin the ex-sentinel. Add some light of Okran to your squad. Some people really hate sentinels though.\r\n- Hamut has vendetta against slavers but was rejected by anti-slaver for being more angry at slavery than anti-slaver...\r\n- Headshot the Shek marksmen. Thinks he is somekind of a badass.\r\n- Hobbs has some tall tales.\r\n- Luquin the legendary noble hunter. Has a few dialogues in UC.\r\n- Miu, ex-slave who escaped to the swamp with Ned. Has some interaction with Hamut. (I ship them) Hate spiders with passion.\r\n- Pia, runner with dead Flotsam Ninja sister.\r\n- Sadneil, even more depressed than your average skeleton.\r\n\r\nUniques with dialogues:\r\n- Burn has just one unique dialogue on entering Deadland. Otherwise Burn jusr use standard skeleton dialogue. Just being skeleton already have a lot of 'interesting' dialogues though.\r\n- Green has just one unique dialogue about thanking for getting out of swamp. Otherwise all his dialogues can be spoken by others. \r\n- Horse has some unique dialoges for entering some biome.\r\n- Lumi the crab lady has special dialogue when seeing crab and on entering Fish Island.\r\n- Ray, the mute soldier drone.

That's right, despite having high stats and one of the most unique recruit dialogue... he has 0 dialogue after that. He doesn't even have normal dialogue package!\r\n- Izumi.

Most 'unique' line of her is shared with Pia...\r\n- Jewel has only one special dialogue reference which can be spoken by other uniques.\r\n- Knife has Flotsam Ninja dialogue package which is rare.

    "description": "Mod to rebalance economy to make in-town shopkeeping more viable and more interesting. Everyone wants to run a comfy inn, right? Now you can do it without every single peasant in town going broke from buying a single rice bowl and not regenerating money, because it's really a buzzkill for a horde of people to flood your tavern and scream about how they can't afford things. Yes, Universal Basic Income has come to the world of Kenshi. On top of that, shopping lists have been expanded in general, more NPCs will go shopping, and there's more of a dynamic to NPC income and spending. \r\n\r\nA few NPCs that lacked them now have shopping lists. Income levels will roughly correspond to class - your average tech hunter will have more spending money and income than your average peasant. \r\n\r\n[b]WEAPONS AND ARMOR HAVE BEEN ADDED TO SHOPPING LISTS![/b]\r\n[i]Yes, you will need to import your game for this to work if you've been using the mod all along.[/i]\r\nNot many NPCs will be prone to buying them, and fewer still will be able to afford your best blades, but they're out there. \r\n\r\nA few notes about the quirks of shopping:\r\n-People actually buy items by class. If someone wants narcotics, they're just as open to hashish as they are to grog as they are to sake. \r\n-The most desired items, by far, are food and alcohol.\r\n-Adventurous types will buy first-aid supplies and sometimes weapons and armor.\r\n-Nobility, if they deign to leave their houses, may stop by your shop for luxury items, trade goods, and random clutter. So will caravans. \r\n-Skeletons drink alcohol too. Don't ask. It was already set up that way. \r\n-Most cities don't have public wells. I HIGHLY URGE YOU TO DOWNLOAD THE [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1321702013]\"MOISTURE FARMING\" MOD BY TRINIMAC[/url] IF YOU WANT TO SET UP SHOP IN A CITY. \r\n-More people should stop by to shop, both in towns and at your outpost.\r\n-If you have a mod that adds additional NPCs, they will be just as poor as the mod maker made them. If you see odd behavior, check your modlist.\r\n\r\nThis also includes a rather cheaty barkeeper start for testing purposes. It gives you basic farming tech, hydroponics, and brewing tech, as well as enough money to buy a small building and set up shop. \r\n\r\nMany thanks to love-tea for showing me how to do the impossible and get NPCs to buy armor and weapons. It was the one feature I really wanted, and now it's here. There will be rebalance releases as I tweak things, please let me know in the comments if anything seems off or like it needs improvement. \r\n\r\nJP translation as follows:\r\n\r\nGoogle翻訳で日本語に翻訳されています。翻訳が貧弱であれば、お詫び申し上げます。\r\n\r\n[h1]メジャーアップデートが削除されました、下記を参照[/h1]\r\n\r\n経済を再調整して、町の店での買い物をより実行可能でより面白くするためのMod。誰もが快適な宿を経営したいのですね。町の農民一人一人が丼を買うのではなく、お金を再生するのをやめてしまうことなく、今やあなたはそれを行うことができます。はい、普遍的な基本所得はKenshiの世界にやって来ました。それに加えて、一般的に買い物リストは拡張され、より多くのNPCが買い物に行くでしょう、そしてNPCの収入と支出にもっとダイナミックなものがあります。\r\n\r\nそれらを欠いていたいくつかのNPCは今買い物リストを持っています。所得水準はおおよそクラスに対応します - あなたの平均的な技術ハンターはあなたの平均的な農民よりも多くの支出と収入を持ちます。\r\n\r\n[b]武器と防具は買い物リストに追加されました！[/b]\r\n[i]はい、modをずっと使っているのであれば、これを機能させるにはゲームをインポートする必要があります。[/i]\r\n多くのNPCがそれらを購入する傾向があるというわけではありません、そしてあなたの最高のブレードを買う余裕がまだあるだろうが、彼らはそこにいます。\r\n\r\n買い物の癖についてのいくつかのメモ：\r\n - 実際には、クラスごとに商品を購入する。誰かが麻薬を欲しがっているならば、彼らは彼らが目的のためにそうするのと同じように彼らが弄ることと同じくらいハッシュにオープンです。\r\n - 最も望ましいアイテムは、これまでのところ、食べ物とアルコールです。\r\n - 冒険好きなタイプは応急処置用品を購入し、時々武器と防具を購入します。\r\n - あなたが彼らの家を出ることを決めた場合、貴族は、高級品、貿易品、そしてランダムな雑然とのためにあなたの店に立ち寄るかもしれません。キャラバンもそうでしょう。\r\n - スケルトンもアルコールを飲みます。聞かないでください。それはすでにそのように設定されていました。\r\n - ほとんどの都市には公営井戸がありません。私はあなたが街にお店をセットアップしたい場合は、トリニマック社による「湿気農業」MODをダウンロードすることを強くお勧めします。\r\n - 町やあなたの前哨の両方で、より多くの人々が買い物に立ち寄るべきです。\r\n - 追加のNPCを追加するMODがある場合、それらはMODメーカーが作ったのと同じくらい貧弱になります。あなたが奇妙な振る舞いをしたならば、あなたのmodlistをチェックしてください。\r\n\r\nこれはまたテスト目的のためのやや厄介なバーキーパー開始を含みます。それはあなたに基本的な農業技術、水耕栽培、そして醸造技術を提供します、そしてまた小さな建物を購入して店を建てるのに十分なお金を与えます。\r\n\r\n不可能を実行してNPCに防具と武器を購入させる方法を教えてくれたLove-teaに感謝します。それは私が本当に欲しかった一つの特徴でした、そして今それはここにあります。私が物事を微調整するときにリバランスリリースがあるでしょう、何かがオフであるように思えるか、それが改善を必要とするようなものであれば私にコメントで知らせてください。モッドは、私が満足しているポイントに近づいていて、大部分は安定していて、まともにバランスが取れています。重大な問題がある場合は、コメントを削除して何が壊れているか教えてください。",

    "description": "Adds weak Enemies squads (1 to 3 members) roaming around, ready for your team to train their fighting skills.\r\n\r\nLeveling the fighting skills in the early game is very difficult, as you will only encounter large squads of tough opponents.\r\nThis leads you to avoiding almost all fights, and only attack when opposing factions' squads are already killing each other.\r\nNot anymore :)\r\n\r\nThis mod adds many squads of 1 to 3 enemies, ready to give you some sweet combat XP.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes :\r\n\r\n- they have (50% the original ones' probability of spawning; for example a vanilla \"Wolf Swarm\" has 4% chance of being spawned in Bonefields. \r\nIts weak version, with 1 to 3 enemies, has 2% chance to spawn.\r\n\r\n- there is a limited number of spawn points in all regions, which can potentially spawn enemy squads.\r\nI tested this by adding hundreds of enemies in the spawn list of a region, with a spawn rate of 100%, they didn't all appear on the map : only one squad can spawn in a spawn point.\r\n\r\n- when a spawn point is activated, the game will look into the spawn list and roll a dice, but will always spawn something.\r\nFor example, let's say a region has 5% chance to spawn bandits and 5% chance to spawn wolves.\r\nOne spawn point can then either spawn a bandit or spawn a wolf, with a 5% probability for each.\r\nI thought that a spawn point could then remain empty, if no bandit or wolf was spawned, but no, the game will instead spawn an animal (for example a spider in the great desert).\r\n\r\n- Most areas have a very low squad spawn chance (less than 5% spawn chance), so the game will most of the time spawn an animal instead.\r\nIn these areas, this mod doesn't lower the difficulty, as it'll have a chance to spawn a weak enemy squad instead of a neutral animal one (though some areas have hostile animals).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think this mod doesn't lower the difficulty in areas where the spawn chances are low (which is the case for most areas).\r\nIt does (slightly) lower the difficulty in areas where the spawn chances are high (so a few areas in the whole game).\r\n\r\nIn order to impact less these high spawn chances areas, I edited this mod so that the weak squads have 50% chance to spawn, compared to their vanilla counterparts.\r\n(From the original 200% I originally set)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to check my other mods, click here :\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1605538512",

    "description": "This mod aims to remove the cheese wealth mechanics that make Kenshi too easy, and make your struggling, suffering and overall challenge in Kenshi greater. If you like it leave a thumbs up.  \r\n\r\nBest played with Shidan's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1116463641&searchtext=longer+contracts]Longer Merc Contracts[/url] mod, Bayrock's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1681216962&searchtext=ironman]Ironman Mod[/url], and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1509740976]Dangerous Hazards[/url]. [i]For mod load order do longer contracts->ESC->DH->ironman, for it to all work correctly.[/i]\r\n\r\n[h1]Econ and Base Changes:[/h1] \r\nEasy cash cheese mechanics nerfed hardcore. Shops are much more discerning now and won’t pay top dollar for used tainted gear that was obviously just looted from a corpse. You will risk starving for a good portion of the game and will cherish hard earned cash much more.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Prices you can sell items for has been drastically reduced. Looted armor and weapon, and player made gear, now sell for 1/4 of the amount you could sell for in vanilla game. \r\n[*]Prices of all other items that are not trade goods now sell for a mere 1/8 of their full value, food, ores, intermediary goods (iron plates etc). \r\n[*]Rare ruin items like power cores and skeletal eyes are 1/2 their value now and are also used for base building. \r\n[*]Trade goods (rum, grog, sake, hashish) sell for about 2/3 to 3/4 their value in vanilla but are now very hard to mass produce due to more labor intensive farming and water changes.\r\n[*]Prices for illegal trade goods reduced significantly across the board.\r\n[*]Medical supplies and luxury goods are now basically non-player made trade goods and still sell for full price so are valuable to find. Cheapo items like cups still sell for full price.\r\n[*]Places where hashish and hemp were legal, but not lawless, have now had their price reduced ever further (such as Catun, Clownsteady, Flat’s Lagoon, Mourn, etc) and you won't make much profit selling at those places.\r\n[*]Shop counters have been disabled.\r\n[*]All crops now take twice as long to harvest. You may now need to allocate multiple farmers to harvest things before they die.\r\n[*]Tanning, making armor plates and making chainmail now use laboring skill instead of armorcrafting.\r\n[*]Animal skins now produce only half a leather instead when you tan them.  \r\n[*]All construction times now double.\r\n[*]All dwelling structures and walls take twice as much building materials to make. \r\n[*]Store bought building materials now doubled in cost.\r\n[*]Doubled all research costs (books, schematics, ai cores, etc) which now slows base development a lot and really forces you out into the world and ruins. \r\n[*]Increased the research time multiplier for higher level technologies. \r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Combat and Creatures:[/h1]\r\nVanilla was too easy with an army of chars, you now need to make the best of a much smaller team and have many of them multitask.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Faction limit now capped at 12 chars.  If you need more than that you will need to spend cats and get mercs.\r\n[*]To make animals more useful in such a small squad the stats of ownable animals have been buffed 15 to 20%, garrus buffed slightly less since they are still best mobile storage. WARNING: This also means similar wild animals types (bonedogs, goats, bulls, garrus, etc) may be tougher.\r\n[*]Attack slots increased to 2 (you can now have 2 people attack the same target at once, and they can do the same to you) so getting swarmed and KO'd by a large mob of weak enemies is a real risk now.\r\n[*]Swamp turtle stats doubled and they have been given a high damage attack type. No longer are they the easy PZ walking meat generators of the swamp. BE WARNED!\r\n[*]Meat drops on all animals reduced significantly from 1/4 to 1/2 their original. Teeth and leather drops also reduced and sell for much less than their old value. Beakthing egg value reduced significantly.\r\n[*]The amount of drop items from uber bosses left unchanged and value of unique drops left unchanged.\r\n[*]All blunt weapon weight reduced by about 25% and given +30% additional armor penetration.\r\n[*]All chaimail armors have had a slight increase to blunt protection since they were a bit weak before.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Water is life now:[/h1] \r\nWater should be one of the most scarce and valuable resources in Kenshi, I've tried some changes to reflect that.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Water table rates halved in most all biomes, reduced even further in some. Swamp is now the only place to have 100.\r\n[*]All wells (even electric ones) now require an operator, making it much more labor intensive, especially in low water areas. To compensate for this, basic non-powered wells no longer count as towns and wont get raided so it is possible to have well outposts (that have nothing but wells) in high water areas and import water in.\r\n[*]All well output reduced, but scaled.  Manual well output reduced by the most, about 50%, while well III reduced the least, about 20%.\r\n[*]All farm field water usage now scales with size, in vanilla they were all the same. A medium field now uses the default amount of water in vanilla. Small fields use half that, large and XL now scale up with XL using about twice what a medium field uses for water.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Differing resources per sector:[/h1]\r\nBiome resources now scale with difficulty. Easier biomes to live in like borderlands now have reduced everything. Iron and Copper reduced significantly in most areas especially easier ones. Specialized biomes like swamp now have the most water but way less minerals and stone. Polluted biomes with no water and food have significantly increased minerals. Harder biomes with difficult creatures and raiders have the best overall resource stats.  See link [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1619600173/1628539187772120098/]here[/url] for detailed listing of changes.\r\n\r\n[h1]Ruins Progression for Base Building[/h1]\r\nSome key base buildings are now locked behind needing ruins gear in order to build them to encourage ruins exploration and make end-game bases more progression based.\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Wind Turbines, fuel generators, and most fully automated heavy machinery now take Advanced Circuitry to build.  The means to fabricate Advanced Circuitry has been lost to time and can only be found in ruins.\r\n[*]Batteries, Skeleton Beds and Robotics Bench now require Power Cores to build.  The technology to make Power Cores has been lost to time and can only be found in ruins. \r\n[*]Harpoons Guns now takes Ancient Long Bore Segments to build. These are pieces of precisely constructed durable alloy barrels which can no longer be manufactured.   Ancient Long Bore Segments can only be found in ruins. \r\n[*]Stone and Iron processors and some other heavy machinery now take Gears to build.  Gears of such quality and durability for industrial use can not be produced anymore and must be traded for or scavenged from old Empire ruins.  \r\n[*]Heavy Armor Smith now take multiple Grind Machine Pieces to build.  Modern smiths never really re-learned the old ways of their pre-industrial ancestors and instead mainly craft their wares using semi-mechanical methods with scavenged metal cutting gear found in ruins. Weapon Smiths II and III take tools to build.\r\n[*]Research Bench 4 now takes a skeleton eye to build in order to properly analyze the cryptic ancient research books and engineering schematics. Skeleton eyes can only be found in ruins.\r\nResearch Bench 5 and 6 take even more Skeleton Eyes to build.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Personal Statement:[/h1]\r\nI made this mod mainly for myself. I love survival games that make you struggle, suffer and feel like you just \"never have enough\". I find it fun being forced to make hard trade offs and tough decisions. This mod isn't for everyone but if you enjoy it, have suggestions, or find errors in it please let me know.",

    "description": "\"Don't go to the floodlands, people who go in there don't come out!\"\r\n\r\n\"No one goes into the deadlands and comes back alive.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of Kenshi are in general agreement that the areas of the world populated by the Old Machines are very dangerous and should be avoided. Unfortunately, by default these areas are mostly barren and what few wandering enemies you discover tend to be rather harmless or slow. A character with a pair of sandals and a few points in athletics can easily make the trip to the scrapyard in order to access the most powerful gear available right from the start. The most dangerous part of the visit is the weather... \r\n\r\nThis mod aims to make these areas more dangerous. Iron Spiders have been given a larger detection radius and will also often be accompanied by smaller lighter Scout Spiders. These aren't quite as deadly and are significantly less durable than regular Iron Spiders. However, they are very fast and quite capable of chasing down runners. Stopping to engage them will give their slower cousins more of a chance to catch up, making them have the potential to actually be dangerous. Areas such as the floodlands and the deadlands can generate the large roaming packs of security spiders that you find in other locations. These will also now include contingents of scout spiders, as can the guard groups found inside of ruins.\r\n\r\nThe rare hostile high skill broken skeletons that you could sometimes run into are more common and can also include sniper varieties with high powered crossbows. Rarer groups of these rogue machines can also spawn together instead of solo.\r\n\r\nOld Machines are now friendly to Skeletons and will coexist better.\r\n\r\nFor best experience, combine this mod with Seth Knight's Scarier Security Spiders mod.",

    "description": "[b]This MOD makes NPC a slave to a player character.[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]What this mod does [/h1]\r\n[b]This mod essentially gives you the ability to have your own slaves as the NPC factions do. [/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]How it works: [/h1]\r\n[b]Make \"Slave Rings\" -> capture enemy -> stick in cage -> put slave ring on him -> prompt will come up asking to \"sell\" slave (you don't actually sell them) -> select the slave and \"sell\" -> you now have a slave you can talk to and issue an array of different instructions (including \"Join my Squad\")\r\n\r\nIf the above doesn't work first time, take the ring back and take the slave out of the cage and attack them till they go down. Then first aid them, put them back in the cage and give them the ring back. This should trigger it.\r\n\r\nFor slaves bought from slave shop you need to have the ring with you when you buy them, you should get the \"sell slave\" prompt shortly after. If not, use the above method.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]Spcial Thanks: Sir Spliffington VIII[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]What can be done for various NPCs [/h1]\r\nNot a slave NPC: to slave\r\nSlave shop slave NPC, and slave captured slave NPC: purchased as a player slave\r\nSlave NPC: Submission\r\nSubmissive slave NPC: order (following, bodyguard, labor etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]Additional research [/h1]\r\n*Shackles Craft ...

Even if it expires it can be redeemed on the spot if outside the town.\r\n* If you want to cancel your mission, please move away from subject.\r\n* The mission success judgment is done also outside the play screen.\r\n(Example) Even if you keep track of the guard object and guard the task for the task and secure it outside the screen\r\nIf you arrive safely in town you will be successful and you will be charged a fee.\r\n* The amount of compensation varies depending on the Tech level of the player and elapsed time after the conversation with the target.\r\nIt does not change in the state of escort target.\r\n* As a known problem, in a transaction (conversation) of a merchant or a mercenary to be escorted\r\nThe elapsed time of the escort is initialized.\r\nTransactions before arriving in town may result in loss of fee amount and loss of compensation fee.

However each cannibal leader is still a formidable opponent. \r\n\r\nThis mod expands on the cannibal faction with new armors weapons and enemies!\r\n\r\nThis will make the cannibals a more formidable force with several new powerful units like.\r\n\r\nThe Mancatchers\r\n\r\nTenderizers \r\n\r\nand Punishers\r\n\r\nHigh ranking units like the grand wizard, meat lord, and even mighty canhead have been given new armor and weapons!\r\n\r\nAll new weapons with rare quality grades for you to find!\r\n\r\nMod requires import! \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think down below\r\n\r\nenjoy!\r\n\r\nShould be compatible with reactive world. In my testing the different tribes will all use the new equipment.

    "description": "This subtly skews the economies of the different factions to open up the 'Trader' style of gameplay. It now becomes much more worth your while organizing trade routes between factions and regions, importing exporting goods. A faction will generally want what they can't produce in their own biomes, and sell cheaply things that they can.\r\n\r\nThis mod works by adding a few more 0.5x to 2.0x standard price modifiers on goods in different areas (adding to what was already there in vanilla). The modifier is first applied to the base price of the commodity before the 'town' price for the good is randomly calculated on the result (vanilla: +/- x50% - x150%), meaning there is still fluctuation between towns keeping each new game (or each import) fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatability:\r\nThis should be fully compatible with most shopkeeper and economic rebalance mods (like Neko's) as this does not touch base prices, only the 'Trade Culture' special modifiers for certain goods. Any mod that just changes what shopkeepers have, or the base cost of items, will still work with this.\r\n\r\nSee \"Discussions\" for a guide, full list of changes, requesting compatibility patches, and reporting bugs/giving feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-Do:\r\nMaybe set up repositories/warehouses in certain, heavily distanced cities, to make it possible to bulk buy an entire Garru's worth of goods if you're willing to haul them, such as a rum distillery in Bark, or a luxury hive artisan in Dreg.",

    "description": "I was inspired to do a cannibal hunter playthrough after testing out Circumsoldier's Cannibals expanded mod, but I was disappointed with how little interaction there is for the cannibal hunter faction. This mod is a WIP expansion of the Cannibal Hunters. So far I've added:\r\n\r\n - 2 unique recruits\r\n - a new game start\r\n - lots of new dialogue\r\n - cannibal hunters can be joined by the player\r\n - cannibal hunters defend your base from cannibal raids if you join them\r\n - new merchant\r\n\r\nPlanned features:\r\n\r\n - more dialogue and campaign events\r\n - possibly some quests if I can get them to work properly\r\n\r\n*This mod will work as a stand-alone but I highly reccomend playing it together with Cannibals Expanded!",

    "description": "This mod is a ressource for modders, and I hope it will help people to get into 3d modeling. \r\nI need your feedback so we might adjust the used zones.\r\n\r\nSo, what is a part map ?\r\nIn FCS, when you create an armor, you can set part map zones.\r\n9 colors are available, 3 are used by default.\r\n\r\nSo what does this mod do ? \r\nVanilla part maps only hide armpits, torso and belly for humans. Hivers actually haven't theirs, and skeleton only have one colour used (only for some parts of the torso. )\r\nThe mod makes use of the 6 remaining colors, so you can actually hide the whole body ! If devs add more colours, I'll separate some zones. For example pelvis and legs, or legs in 2 parts (which would help for vanilla pants that clip). \r\nIt also adds hivers (queen excepted) a real part map for them, as they used human's while having absolutely not the same texture pattern.\r\nThat means that all hiver races but queen have a new path (so  beware for compatibility issues, even if kenshi is well made for handling it). \r\n\r\nWhy ? \r\nBecause it extends modding possibility. Want to make a helmet that replaces the body with another one? You can.\r\nWanna make high heels for the waifu ? You can.\r\nWanna make very close to body armors without worrying too much with clipping ? You can.\r\n\r\nHow can i use it for my mod ?\r\nJust check at the pictures to get an idea of which zones are covered by which color. In FCS you'll have to check these colors is you need to hide a part.\r\nFor example, orange will hide hands ! \r\n\r\nComplete zones list: \r\nWhite zone (vanilla) : armpits ; https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670240465\r\nRed zone (vanilla) : torso/boobs : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670238483\r\nGreen zone (vanilla) belly (front only) : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670239531\r\n\r\nNew zones (could change, because i'd like it to be a community thing, for modder convenience without altering vanilla ones). \r\nBlue : rest of the torso and back, that are not covered by vanilla\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670240302\r\nMagenta : Arms without hands : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670239337\r\nCyan: feet, at the moment stops at ankle, could cover vanilla boot zones \r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670239811\r\nyellow : neck (might add any zone barely used, as the zones should mask everything)\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670238084\r\norange : hands : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670239131\r\npurple : legs + pelvis https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1670238954\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, head cannot be hidden, that would be even more fabulous for modding possibility, but maybe it'll change ;) . \r\n\r\n",

So if you persist, they will follow you or try to escape alone from such persistence. Speaking of single escapes, their chances are also changed, so if singles will be caught, the next time when they are released, they can follow you. Thus there is a chance to lead all slaves to freedom and the possibility of their recruitment.\r\n\r\nimport required\r\n\r\nFREEDOM FOR ALL SLAVES!\r\n\r\nЭтот простой мод позволяет освободить всех рабов. В оригинале рабы могли быть «капризными» и могли не хотеть покидать свои родные клетки. Теперь они будут «капризными» только с вероятностью 70%. Поэтому, если вы будете настойчивы, они последуют за вами или попытаются уйти в одиночку от такой настойчивости. Говоря об одиночных побегах, их шансы также изменились, поэтому, если одиночки будут пойманы, в следующий раз когда они будут освобождены, они могут последовать за вами. Таким образом, есть шанс привести всех рабов к свободе и возможности их вербовки.\r\n\r\nтребуется перенос\r\n\r\nСВОБОДУ ВСЕМ РАБАМ!",

The mod does the same for boots.\r\n\r\n2)By fixing meshes that clip even when not used in combination with other equipment\r\n\r\n[h1] Equipment that alternative meshes were made for: [/h1]\r\n\r\n[b] Pants: [/b]\r\nDrifter’s leather pants, cargopants, halfpants, all the pants that use monk mesh, wornout shorts, rag loincloth, armoured rag skirt, hack stopper pants, crab trousers, plated drifter’s leather pants, stout hessian, and female samurai leggplates.\r\n\r\n[b] Boots: [/b]\r\nDrifter’s leather boots, plated longboots, and all samurai boots.\r\n\r\n[b] Headgear: [/b]\r\nArmoured hood, Bucket Zukin, Karuta Zukin and Turban.\r\n\r\n[b] The game already has slimmed down meshes for samurai clothpants and samurai leggplates.

    "description": "[h1]Hi, welcome to DialoguePlus+! [/h1]\r\n\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/fVVaDCS.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to add more variation in dialogue you encounter around the world of Kenshi, and tries to keep it all serious & lore friendly. You should hear more variation in bar chatter, in raids, attacks, et cetera!\r\n\r\nIt also aims to tweak and fix any typos or grammatical errors left behind by the development team, and expand on existing wordswaps functions to give more variation even in vanilla dialogue.\r\n\r\nI've lost count of lines, but I believe it's around or above 1000 lines now added to the game.\r\n\r\nOpen to queries and suggestions, if you want a conversation I'm Chime#9999 on discord or you can just add me here on Steam. I am more active on Discord, however.\r\n\r\n[h1]Areas currently expanded upon:[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Bar Dialogue added to the Holy Nation bars. Around 250 lines, with plenty of variation and wordswaps!\r\n[*] Generic Bar dialogue added to most non HN bars.\r\n[*] A somewhat comedic variation on player characters screaming about Acid Water.\r\n[*] More biome comments added to: Darkfinger, Deadlands\r\n[*] Small addition to Flotsam Ninjas.\r\n[*] Variations added to the \"Attack\" dialogue, specific to certain conditions your characters may have.\r\n[*] More band of bones shouting.\r\n[*] More local variation added to bars in the Hook.\r\n[*] More bar chatter added to Mongrel.\r\n[*] New slave intro.\r\n[*] A little more variation on swamp ninjas.\r\n[*] More wordswaps.\r\n[*] More dialogue! [/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Compatibility:[/h1]\r\nShould be fine with all other mods!\r\n\r\nPrefer using NexusMods?

    "description": "Legend of the Grievewraith\r\n“\tHoly Nation legend tells of the souls of the lost Shek becoming consumed by malice, hate and envy for the living. Their naturally 'aggressive' nature, as the Okranites claim, make them the most easily corruptable by the 'demoness'. The Grievewraith consists of a rotting corpse with the spikes, or limbs, of a flesh insect protruding from it's back, supposedly this is it's mid-transformation into a beast.\r\n\r\nNow, legend aside, we've had numerous sightings of these wraithes both by Holy Nation residents and adventurers, mainly around the ruins of the central plains. So far we've learned that they are nocturnal and they prefer to take victims in the rubble of cities which have been heavily touched by death. All of it's victims have disappeared without trace, we can only assume fully consumed by the wraith. A likely explanation for their existence would be a parasitic form of flesh insect, one which roots itself into the boney matter of a Shek body, and continues to grow and control the body even after it's victim has perished and begun decomposition.\r\n\r\n- Idad  \"\r\n\r\nBased upon the legend and a broken model I found in the game files.\r\n\r\nYou thought blood spiders were scary? Wraiths make them look like cute puppies in comparison... Both faster and waaaaay stronger... Even high level characters are likely to be eaten en masse. They're mostly nocturnal and sometimes spawn nests. Okran help you if you blindly walk into a nest...\r\n\r\nIf you see a wraith, best thing to do is run unless you got a hardened platoon armed with desert sabres. Though if you do manage to kill one, you can sell their horns for a large profit, even more so in the holy nation.\r\n\r\nThey mostly spawn in the holy nation territory... Mercifully they're rare so you wont see many if any at all.\r\n\r\nDon't go near the ruins in Skinner's Roam unless you have a deathwish.\r\n\r\nOther Legends:\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1877448247] Mist Ghouls [/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1882920758] Foulhounds [/url]\r\n\r\nPatches\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1882919742] Tame Beastie",

    "description": "This simple mod allows you to level buildings without development tools or having to carefully drag it. Buildings have a natural and realistic look and play very well. Doesn't take anything off from the vanilla gameflow, balance or difficulty. It's intended to be used on [b]uneven terrain[/b] but it works fine as much as inside hill walls. Should work well with just about any mod and savefile as it just change footprint placing permissions.\r\n\r\n[b]Please, read carefully before asking questions. Enjoy it and have fun[/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]What does it do:[/h1] \r\n\r\nCompletely removes slope requirements for buildings so they can be placed in any terrain.\r\nThe terrain gets removed from inside of the buildings, so it can be placed as much as inside mountain walls.\r\nIncrease vertical position tolerance, so players can make their buildings as high as there's foundation underneath [url=https://imgur.com/OMrvsfr](Default ' - and = ')[/url]\r\nAll that can be done without the development tool, so you don't need to cheat and move the structure. Just place buildings like usual\r\nShould work with your previous save (no need to New Game or Import) and just about any mod, even those that deal with buildings and new towns. Just make sure to set Slopeless at the bottom of the mod order list\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]Known issues:[/h1]\r\n\r\nBuildings still follow slopes. You just 've got to hold your change slope hotkey [url=https://imgur.com/OMrvsfr](Default ' ] ')[/url] and it snaps perfectly\r\nBuildings with balcony inside the terrain mess up. People can go upstairs and teleport above ground and that screws up pathfinding too. Just don't use buildings with balcony inside hills if you don't want that to happen\r\nHills cutting through balcony have no collision but they do appear. Doesn't screw people navigation and actually looks pretty cool, but ideally people would be able to climb that leftover piece of terrain instead of ignoring it\r\nDoesn't help much with walls. It does allow you to place them anywhere but it still looks weird\r\n[url=https://imgur.com/a/hNjBxPC]Removes building collision with other buildings[/url]. Overlapped buildings behaviour is such that both buildings keep it's collisions and textures, so the overlapped section have no pathfinding. This means that they work actually fine and that's just a aesthetic concern that players can avoid. Also a little bit of overlapping, specially as long it's unreachable parts colliding (foundations) actually makes sense and is completelly harmless\r\nWhen trying to zoom and look from inside buildings inside cliffs the camera colides with the hill. Easily manageable but a little annoying\r\n\r\n[h1][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1740462542/3264459260614750315/]FOUND A ISSUE?[/URL]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1740462542/3264459260603128302/]SUGGESTIONS AND REQUESTS[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1740462542/3264459260603094720/]CHANGELOG[/url][/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]This mod isn't deeply tested.

There's also a new game start where you start with a Bloodhound pup.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to see all creatures before installing the mod, screenshots of every new creature in their natural habitat can be found on my Steam profile page.\r\n\r\nAlso now there is a CHEAT start for testing purposes but I wouldn't recommend using it. Some of the new animal (concepts) are meant to surprise you and you'd spoil that for you. \r\n\r\nI'm by no means a professional 3D Artist. All I did was messing around with Blender and Gimp. Expect some minor flaws, like slightly distorted textures. Please tell me if I may have made any obvious errors that need fixing.\r\n\r\nPlease also report if you find any inconsistencies or balancing issues. Like animals spawning in unexpected places, being too strong or too weak, conflicts between animals and npcs that shouldn't / mustn't happen, etc.\r\n\r\nWhy TIHYD? \r\n=================================================================\r\n\r\nThis is a reference to my now second favourite game-of-all-times, Project Zomboid, whose savegame loading screen motto is \"This is how you died\". Try it out, it's great! I love rogue-like gameplay and plan to publish a series of mods which make Kenshi even more diverse, immersive, harder... and deadly!

    "description": "I'm just adding a little more life into the game. Should make the game easier but only in the sense that it adds some lore friendly stuff.\r\n\r\nNPCs added so far:\r\n\r\nAspiring Mercenaries; Young mercenaries who can't justify to charge so much. Won't cost you more than a couple hundred cats. Squads range from 2 to 6 mercenaries, each merc is capable of handling 2-3 dust bandits on their own. I've placed them where they're most likely to survive their contracts with you - the Hub and in Holy Nation territory.\r\n\r\nPilgrim Faction/Pilgrims: Need to sneak into holy nation territory due to hostility or bounty? These guys will be wandering around HN territory completely unarmed and weak. They have their own faction, so the HN won't accuse you of uniform theft. Downside is that they're hard to find - they can occasionally be found wandering holy nation territories. Do remember that the HN can see through disguises if you're a skeleton.\r\n\r\nTrade Ninja Caravan: Trade ninjas will now send caravans to you when you set up a base. They send 6 ninjas and a garru. They deal in just about everything, from books to materials to food to weapons. I'm... not sure about their acid protection, so if you want some free loot I guess set up in a really shitty place I guess.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'll update this mod ever so often, usually to suite my own needs or desires. Mostly I want more outpost shenanigans as I find that having a base is kind of boring. The goal of the mod is to be as lore friendly as possible so I won't be adding any new factions aside from the pilgrim faction and a shek disguising faction (you can disguise as the slavers for the United Cities so I won't be adding one for them). \r\n\r\nFuture Inhabitants of Kenshi:\r\n\r\nA beggar visits your base\r\nA (mean) beggar visits your base and insults you\r\nUnited Cities sends ninjas to your base to gage your strength\r\nMercenary Guild employs disgraced Shek as Shek Kamikaze mercs for you to employ\r\nA rich man and his annoying wife visit your base to do some shopping, hilarity right out of a 1980's sitcom ensues\r\nVarious groups of adventurers much like you, found roaming the world and may occasionally visit your base\r\nPilgrims visit your base and try to convert you to Okran\r\nPilgrims visit your base on a pilgrimmage (positive relations with Holy Nation)\r\nPilgrims visit your base and insult you (negative relations with Holy Nation)\r\n(Rare event) Pilgrims hire assassins to kill you (negative relations with Holy Nation)\r\nHounds drug runners occasionally visiting your base/various cities\r\nProbably more idk\r\n\r\nAll of those will be uncommon so as not to disrupt game play.\r\n\r\nThe biggest factor slowing this all down is that I am just so uninspired to do dialogue rn.\r\n\r\nWhether or not an NPC will be recruitable with the prisoner recruitment mod depends on whether or not the mod owner merely changed dialogue packages or added dialogue to the character. If he changed the dialogue packages then they'll be as recruitable as their respective equivalents (ninja to ninja, merc to merc, pilgrim to holy nation civilian etc).\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "This is a mod that removes cut efficiency and applies that value towards cut resistance instead.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about Kenshi's cut efficiency. In theory, it's a nifty idea to have a certain percent of resisted cut damage to be converted to blunt damage instead. However, the execution is just ridiculous. You immediately take the blunt damage regardless of all subsequent layers of armor protecting that area. This results in absurd, backwards scenarios where wearing lower quality armor (or even none) can be superior to more layers of armor.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\nPretend you take a 100 cut damage hit to the right leg. You are wearing (all Masterwork) a Dustcoat, Samurai Legplates, and Samurai Boots. The Dustcoat has 60% coverage, meaning a 60% chance of blocking damage. If it does, you block 26 cut damage (44% Cut Resist * 60% Cut Efficiency) and you take an immediate 18 direct blunt damage (44 resisted - 26 blocked = 18 damage from inefficiency) from cut efficiency regardless of any other protection. The remaining 56 goes to the next layer. The Legplates have 100% chance to block 40 damage, take an immediate 5 damage (thanks efficiency), and the remaining 11 go to the next layer. The Boots have 100% efficiency, so you have a 40% chance to block 9 of 11 damage. So in total you take 25 or 34 damage.\r\n\r\nNow if you TAKE OFF the Dustcoat (or the 40% chance it MISSES it), if you REMOVE that extra layer of protection, the Legplates receive all 100 damage. You block 73, take an immediate 8 damage (efficiency), and the remaining 19 goes to Boots. 40% chance the Boots will block 15 of 19 damage. In total, you take 12 or 27 damage.\r\n\r\nBecause of this backwards, awful efficiency system, you reduce more damage by striping off a Masterwork layer of protection than keeping it on. Even worse, wearing a PROTOTYPE Dustcoat reduces more damage than a Masterwork thanks to this system (take less direct damage from cut efficiency, more damage mitigated by Legplates).\r\n\r\nThis illogical system frustrated me to the point of making this mod. What it does is instead applies the efficiency value towards cut resistance, so a Dustcoat with 44% cut resist, 60% cut efficiency will instead have 26% cut resist (44% * 0.6). Using the previous example as a reference, the Dustcoat still blocks 26 cut damage but now all of the remaining 74 (56+18) goes onto the next layer. No immediate direct damage ignoring all other armor. No dumb \"More protection is worse protection\" absurd scenarios. \r\n\r\nThat's it. There are no other special tweaks or adjustments to give a player advantages or disadvantages. Just removing cut efficiency and adjusting cut resistance to account for it. This will make characters, both player and enemy, a bit more resilient to cut damage as they are no longer taking magic direct damage.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n[h1]\"Why not just have the converted cut-to-blunt damage pass to the next layer instead of removing Cut Efficiency entirely?\"[/h1]\r\n\r\nSince about half of this mod's comments are asking about this, I'll put the answer here. The reason is because I can't. So far as I'm aware, modders have no access to the game's formulas or calculations. This mod is a workaround that still passes the damage to the next layer but without converting it to blunt. It is an imperfect solution, but that's all I can do with the FCS toolset. Only the dev could change the actual calculation to pass the converted blunt on.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n[h1]\"What about armors introduced by other mods?\"[/h1]\r\n\r\nThis mod does not alter a single non-vanilla armor. However, I recently did work some of the more popular.\r\n\r\nNCE for Gusoku Armor Set:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1817569665\r\n\r\nNCE for Mediocre Black Armor:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1817606982\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAlso, another modder by the name of blot made several additional NCE patches for other armor mods. I double-checked blot's numbers for the new cut resistances (adjusted to account for removed cut efficiency) and, while not perfect for every single piece, the most deviation I saw was 1-2% on a couple of the Masterwork versions (ie, 52% instead of the expected 51%). Not too shabby for the volume of patches he made. If you're interested, here's the list:\r\n\r\nNCE for OMO'S ARMOUR for the World:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1830612586\r\n\r\nNCE for More Plate Options:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1830613354\r\n\r\nNCE for Dread Gear:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1830578945\r\n\r\nNCE for Dread Bindings:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1830579476\r\n\r\nNCE for Wolf Headgear:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1830580832\r\n\r\nNCE for Impaler Armor Set:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1830581571\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYet another modder by the name of Thundercraft made several additional NCE patches for other armor mods. If you're interested, here's the list:\r\n\r\nNCE for Unique Phoenix Armor:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1994389873\r\n\r\nNCE for Black Dragon Ninja Armour:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1994504948\r\n\r\nNCE for The Dust King:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1994513031\r\n\r\nNCE for \"Wear your hats with everything\":\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2002916934\r\n\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n\r\nThis mod edits \"cut def bonus\" and \"cut into stun\" values for every piece of armor with cut efficiency. If you have another mod that edits those values, place this above or below it in your load order depending on which mod's effects you prefer (put the one you prefer lower in the list). It does not modify any armors outside of the vanilla game.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n(2020-03-05)\r\nUpdate to included Monk Robe, Black Rag Shirt, and Holy Servant Rags.\r\n\r\n(2020-03-02)\r\nAdded Thundercraft's patches to the list for non-vanilla armor mods. Download them separately from the links above.\r\n\r\n(2019-09-06)\r\nAdded a guide in the Discussions page for how to make your own NCE edits for armors from other mods.\r\n\r\n(2019-08-25)\r\nAdded blot's patches to the list for non-vanilla armor mods. Download them separately from the links above.\r\n\r\n(2019-07-28)\r\nMade 2 patches to non-vanilla armor mods. Download them separately from the links above.\r\n\r\n(2019-07-18) v3\r\nUpdate to included Dyed Robes.\r\n\r\n(2019-07-17) v2\r\nUpdate to include the three versions of Halfpants I had missed.\r\n\r\n(2019-07-16) v1\r\nThis is the first version of the mod, which I'm calling version 0.9. I've combed through all the armors multiple times to make sure I did not miss any, and I've checked dozens of sets of armors to make sure all the cut resistance values are right across varying qualities. However, I am still human and may have still missed one or fudged a value somewhere. Let me know if you find any armor showing unusual resistances or still depicting cut resistance, and I'll try to fix it right up.\r\n\r\nLastly, because of some hidden scales and values I cannot predict, a few of lower quality versions of armors may be 1% off of their expected resistance due to rounding errors. The mod edited every Masterwork to its new cut resistance and lets the quality system take care of the rest.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.",

    "description": "Mercenary Reworked By PositiveBuff\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe main idea of this Mod is improving and refining the rough mercenary mechanism of the vanilla Kenshi (for example, the price of most vanilla employable squads is 2000 cats per day even their combat ability are different or their number are different). I also add some stories and dialogs about the background of Mercenary Guild.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nBrief Introduction:\r\n1. The price of mercenaries and other squads will be determined by the ability and quantity of mercenaries. Human mercenaries in the Holy Nation are cheaper, while Tech Hunter squads are expensive.\r\n\n2. Most employers need to pay a large deposit in advance to prevent casualties (especially death or disability). But some employers have earned the trust of mercenaries and no deposit is needed.\r\n3. The Mercenary Guild refuse to serve the employers on the blacklist. These employers had let loyal mercenaries execute suicide missions.\r\n4. Mercenary Guild managers work in some bars, and employers can ask them to retrieve their deposits when the contract is completed. You can ask them for stories about the guild and the deposit.\r\n5. The Wandering Trader (the game start) has earned trust of mercenaries in some past, so no deposit is needed.\r\n6. At the end of the bodyguard mission, renewals can be made. The contract will be extended for one day. The conditions for renewal are that the mercenaries are not seriously injured; there is no ongoing battle; the employer and mercenary squad leader is close enough to active a dialogue.\r\n7. Mercenary Guild managers can help you post some notices and summon interested Tech Hunter squads to your outpost for defensive missions. The higher reward attached to the notice, the higher probability of the present of Tech Hunter squads, the earlier their arrival, and the larger number of the squad.\r\n8. Further refine the interesting employable faction Black Dog, adding background stories and a little plot between the Black Dog and the Mercenary Guild. Players can tap into the secrets by listening the conversation between the two sides, exploring the Black Dog HQ and some bar chats.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in this mod, please explore in the game and may find some more interesting contexts~\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nMatters needing attention:\n\r\nOld saves need to be imported.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nRecent updates:\r\n- Squads over 20 people can be hired now (but need much more cats to unlock the hire option).\r\n- Some changes to improve potential compatibility with other mods.\r\n- Add a stronger mercenary squad if the Mercenary Guild take over the Manhunter base.",

    "description": "How is this different than other color mods?\r\n\r\nMost of them dye armor using the existing colormaps in the game - a splotch on the chest, a spot on the head.\r\n\r\nI have redone (or created new) colormaps for most of the armor in the game - that is, defining WHERE on the armor your colors show. Instead of \"splotch on chest,\" the entire armor is now colored.\r\n\r\nThis affects all NPC factions as well - now they look distinct and show their true colors.\r\n\r\nI have preserved details like material texture, leather straps, metal rivets, etc. instead of just \"dipped in a paint bucket\" effect that turns everything to mud.\r\n\r\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE\r\n\r\nIn 30 seconds you can customize the player's faction colors to anything you want. All armor you wear in game will become this color scheme. Tired of those colors? 30 more seconds to change it. Make a dozen different settings for my mod, and choose whichever color scheme you feel like using when you start the game!\r\n\r\nHOW I DO DIS\r\n\r\nI will make a video if this isn't clear, but it's super simple.\r\n\r\nStart Kenshi in Steam\r\nOpen the FCS\r\nClick the button to make a new mod, making sure only the game's 4 base files, in the top box, are checked.\r\nName it anything you want, like \"MyFirstColorScheme,\" or \"BlueAndGrey,\" or \"Humphrey.\"\r\n\r\nOn the left, click on COLOUR SCHEME.\r\nRightclick anywhere in the right and click NEW ITEM\r\nMake the name NamelessPlayer\r\n^^^^ YOU MUST NAME IT EXACTLY THAT, NamelessPlayer ^^^^^\r\nClick Color1. Click the button on the right. Ooooo, a color palette appears!\r\nChoose your favorite color. This is now your faction's PRIMARY color.\r\nClick Color 2. Click the button. I'm sure you can guess the rest. This is now your faction's SECONDARY color.\r\n\r\nSave mod.\r\n\r\nClose FCS.\r\n\r\nStart Kenshi.\r\n\r\nActivate your file you just made in the MODS list and Save changes. MAKE SURE YOUR FILE IS BELOW MINE IN THE LIST, OF COURSE.\r\n\r\nNow your choices are your faction colors.\r\n\r\nStarting a new playthrough? Feel like RPing a different group?\r\nWait, don't edit your first file! Make another one, with a differnet name!\r\nMake as many as you want! When you get bored with one colorscheme, deselect it in the Mods list, and activate a different one!\r\n\r\nI feel like it's in good shape for a 1.0 release, so here it is. I will likely continue to improve the textures and maps based on feedback, or finding mistakes, or sudden whim at 2 AM on a Saturday night.\r\n",

    "description": "This mod is based on a comment from Chris Hunt, the creator of Kenshi, duing the recent AMA on reddit.\r\n\r\n\"I usually trade and wander and get into scrapes, I think that's the most fun way to play. I frown upon mining as an income source. In the future I might make it harder, like rival miners or town guards demanding you have a mining licence or something.\"\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking, we already have the tools to make this possible in the FCS. So I set up a tariff on copper.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does is add dialogue triggers to shop keepers and united city gate guards to stop you if you have copper in your inventory.\r\n\r\nThe gate guards will search your bag, and if you have any copper, they will demand 5000 cats as a tariff on the copper. The tariff is waved if you have a copper trading writ, which can be purchased from Yamdu at Trader's edge. You can also try to bribe the guards to let you through or run away.\r\n\r\nMerchants will now refuse to trade with you if you have copper, unless you have a copper trading writ. You can also try to bribe them to let you trade anyways.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this mod is to remove the easy money that copper mining provides in the early game and hopefully add a little complexity to the trading systems. If this mod proves popular, I'll expand it to include other resources, implement different tariffs for different factions, and make it so that most traders require a license before trading.",

    "description": "Do you want a playable Hiver Queen in your life, but don't like some of the graphical elements I won't mention here because they may be spoilers? Then our patented Hive Princess  is for you! This highly uncustomizable addition to your world features;\r\n\r\nNo Pheromones: Don't worry about being mentally enslaved and cursed to live a pitiful existence of servitude! Your playable queen features none of this!\r\n\r\nClipping Issues: I did my best but there might be some interesting relationships between headgear and your new Hiver Princessn. I recommend Armored Face Plates for your beefy Warrior Princesses.\r\n\r\nMaybe Too Big: She's kinda big. There's not much to say here, sometimes the game gets silly with Shek-sized models. She looks fantastic with heavy weapons and kind of silly with polearms or shorter katanas.\r\n\r\nTenuous Lore Compatibility: We all know there is just the ONE TRUE QUEEN that we all should worship and serve faithfully while shunning the hiveless ones. But let's just pretend that, sometimes, somewhere a little magic happens and a sterile queen-like hiver  is created. I wanted to make a custom crafting station that took meat and skins and created drones but I couldn't figure it out. :( Also she is just a regular hiver genderwise because I found a whooooole lot of weird clipping issues when setting a hiver body to female.\r\n\r\nQuestionable Balance Decisions: The Hive Queen is a singular high maintenance unit that features higher than average hiver health [100hp limbs, 150hp head], fast regeneration [a blazing 2x modifer!] but middling skill aptitudes [++medic ++toughness, --farming --laboring --perception] and middling stat aptitudes [+10% Dex and Str]. Her combat speed multiplier is the same as a Hiver Soldier Drone.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nCompatibility Patches: Make sure these go below the Clean Queen mod and the other mod in question.\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1863611717]Race Blood[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1863617267]Military Craft[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1864602859]More Combat Animations[/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1870435613]Animation Overhaul Mod - Crafting[/url]\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nOnce you import your save or start a new game you should be able to find a unique Hiver Princess hanging out at the bar in The Hub named Bugmom! You may also spot them in the wild hanging out in bars, at approximately 1/5th the rate of Hiver Princes. Rare, but not impossible!\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nPlease leave any feedback below. I am not a good modder but I hope you enjoy her.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nPlease leave any feedback below. I am not a good modder but I hope you enjoy her.",

    "description": "Legend of the Mist Ghoul\r\n“\tSightings of hovering ghoulish creatures from the misty caverns west of the Holy Nation plains. The ghouls possess elongated, black frames with long fingers, glowing eyes and a mouth that stretches to the size of a full grown man.\r\nTravellers who delve into the mist are renowned for not returning again, until further notice expeditions are to be avoided in the area.\r\n\r\n- Idad ”\r\n\r\nIn the same style as my previous Grievewraith mod, this aims to bring one of the legends to life in the form of a new and interesting enemy.\r\n\r\nFogmen are scary enough but have you ever wondered if there's anything worse lurking in the mist? The mist ghouls have you covered. They don't eat, don't bleed, don't talk, are unnaturally fast and incredibly tough. \r\n\r\nThey're not common by any stretch of the imagination... You'd be lucky to spot one at all when travelling through the islands. Though... They say that the deepest areas of the fog hold terrors unimaginable... Or you could just follow the trails of dead fogmen.\r\nThey mostly come in 3 different forms with their own little quirks:\r\n\r\n- Mist Fiend: Scrawny and REALLY quick, you ain't running away from these.\r\n- Mist Ghoul: Middle man, most common variant and usually spawn in pairs or in groups with Fiends.\r\n- Mist Horror: Big and scary, especially tough and commonly seen alone.\r\n- ???\r\n\r\nThey all have fairly low defence (not much but enough to defend themselves from low level characters). However their attacks are damn near unblockable. The trick is to overwhelm them before they overwhelm you.\r\n\r\nThe mod also adds in 2 new weapons:\r\n\r\n- Forked Cleaver: Sometimes used by the ghouls (Blueprints can be found in Mongrel).\r\n- ???\r\n\r\nOther Legends:\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1729572902] Grievewraiths [/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1882920758] Foulhounds [/url]\r\n\r\nPatches:\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1877766165] If you want to play as these [/url]\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1877769051] Combat animation mods compatibility [/url]\r\n\r\nI advise importing if you want to get the most out of this mod.",

    "description": "This mod adds a heavier version of the mercenary plate armor. It is essentially an unholy chest plate with the pauldrons and arm plates of mercenary plate, plus some armor for the back. It has slightly better protection than the unholy chest plate and covers 80% of the arms, rather than 25%, but is more expensive, significantly heavier, and has higher combat penalties because of all the extra bulk. The armor and its blueprint are sold anywhere the unholy chest plate is.\r\n\r\nVersion 10 Update:\r\n-Overhauled the textures to be less glossy and also a bit less filthy.\r\n\r\nVersion 9 Update:\r\n-Fixed most of the weird stretching issues, particularly in the chest/stomach/waist area of female characters (finally - Kenshi is so weird in how they do female armatures and fixing this took me ages)\r\n-Further dirtied the armor\r\n\r\nVersion 8 Update:\r\n-Added weathering effects to the armor's texture\r\n-Reduced glossiness\r\n-The shoulder straps now move with your shoulders\r\n-Added dust storm protection to the helmet and a little acid protection to the chest and leg pieces\r\n-Compressed the textures to reduce file size\r\n\r\nVersion 7 Update:\r\n-Added faction colors. Since this might not be to everyone's taste, I added them as a separate patch, found here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1905943482 .\r\n-This will probably be the last change I make to this mod, unless any major issues pop up, as I'm happy with it in its current state and tinkering can be all-consuming if you let it be.\r\n\r\nVersion 6 Update:\r\n-Added pants and boots! Now you can collect the whole heavy set.\r\n\r\nVersion 5 Update:\r\n-Added a helmet! The Mercenary Bascinet is now available, both as an item and a blueprint, at the same vendors where you'd buy the armor. It is statted as a heavy version of the visored helmet, and all that entails.\r\n-Updated the armor's texture (again).\r\n-Note that if you look up at the helmet from underneath, parts of the inside may look invisible. This is something I just noticed and will try to fix in the next update, but it's not a very noticeable thing.\r\n-The helmet's base model was a free download from the lovely www.cgtrader.com, which has plenty of good stuff I may use in future updates. All credit goes to them - I mostly just made it work with Kenshi.\r\n\r\nVersion 4 Update:\r\n-Updated the textures to be a little more grey and a little less brown. Also added some high/low-lighting for more detail.\r\n-Removed the worst of the clipping issues, particularly on female characters. Note that characters with particularly small waists or large chests will still get some weird clipping.\r\n-Updated the icon to better reflect the new texture.\r\n\r\nVersion 3 Update:\r\n-Female textures should now be working properly.\r\n-Improved (hopefully) the textures all around to better fit the game's color scheme.\r\n-Removed the legplates, since they were really just getting in the way.\r\n-Added an inventory icon.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-Particularly strange body types may cause clipping\r\n-I'm still working on implementing faction colors.",

The volume is just way too loud.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to not feel like I've suddenly walked into a frickin' subwoofer set to over 9,000, I've lowered the volume on music files that abuse decibels worse than a shady underground nightclub.\r\nSpecifically, I've lowered the decibel count by 5 all across the board, so it's not going to be volume-abusive but the emotion and atmospheric quality is still there.\r\n\r\nThere are probably other pieces of music that are too loud, so if anyone notices any then let me know where you were in the game at the time the music played (the more precise, the better).\r\n\r\nSo far, the following music files have been tweaked:\r\n\r\n**Dunes_Music_Bank.BNK**\r\n- 0020.WEP\r\n- 0025.WEP\r\n- 0032.WEP\r\n- 0054.WEP\r\n\r\n**Savannah_Music_Bank.BNK**\r\n- 0019.WEP\r\n- 0032.WEP\r\n- 0044.WEP\r\n- 0050.WEP\r\n- 0058.WEP\r\n- 0068.WEP\r\n\r\n**Swamplands_Music_Bank.BNK**\r\n- 0026.WEP\r\n- 0038.WEP\r\n- 0040.WEP\r\n- 0055.WEP\r\n\r\n**Tarsands_Music_Bank.BNK**\r\n- 0002.WEP\r\n- 0019.WEP\r\n- 0020.WEP\r\n- 0048.WEP\r\n\r\nAlthough the game originally plays music as .WEP audio files within their .BNK archives, this mod leaves the tweaked individual music files as .OGG, which is a lossless format.\r\nLossless format has a much larger file size compared to compressed alternatives, so I may consider recompressing all tweaked audio back into .WEP in the near future.\r\n\r\nAs of version 5 (Steam Workshop version) of Don't Burst My Ear Drums, I think I've found and tweaked all of the major culprits of decibel abuse, but I'll continue to test further and see (or hear) if anything else crops up.",

    "description": "Very basic mod to add a Meitou of every weapon type missing to the world. This is done in an as non-intrusive method as possible. In some cases I swapped quality levels on characters, a few others I changed their weapon types, but only on characters with no notable melee weapon, and in one case swapped out a Meitou that was available elsewhere for a new one. As well as one case where I added a minor vanilla unique that didn't normally spawn.\r\n\r\nObviously, any character that has recieved one may be far stronger than they were before the upgrade, so procede with caution.\r\n\r\nMeitou Locations:\r\nBull Horn Axe: [spoiler]Flying Bull at New Kralia[/spoiler]\r\nFlesh Cleaver: [spoiler]Grand Cannibal at Cannibal Capital[/spoiler]\r\nIron Club: [spoiler]No-Face at Strange Camp[/spoiler]\r\nIron Stick:[spoiler]Mighty Canhead (Base Raid)[/spoiler]\r\nLong Cleaver: [spoiler]Meat Lord at First Village[/spoiler]\r\nMercenary Club: [spoiler]Gutterhead at Old Control Tower[/spoiler]\r\nNaginata Katana: [spoiler]Jaegar at Spring[spoiler]\r\nPlank: [spoiler]Valamon at Ark[/spoiler]\r\nSpiked Club: [spoiler]Manhunter Boss at Manhunter Base[spoiler]\r\n\r\nLooking for a place to discuss Kenshi or Kenshi modding?

    "description": "[img]https://i.imgur.com/p7Fv1Z6.gif[/img]\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to add more realism to combat. \r\nUnlocking attack slots was neccesary, but that is not enough and it didn't felt right, therefore blocking chance and atack chance have been reworked. Skill will be more relevant than ever when being outnumbered, this mod is not intended for new players, it will make combat harder  but more rewarding with proper training. To be clear, block and dodge are now crucial, train them and you'll be unstoppable.    \r\n\r\nFeatures (short read):\r\n\r\n- Unlocks attack slots x3 \r\n- Reworked block chance %, \r\n- Reworked attack chance %,\r\n- Adds organ damage to blunt attacks, \r\n- Cuts cause more immediate blood loss \r\n- Changed max and min damage resistance (achieved by leveling toughness)\r\n- Damage resistance from a hit can be random (up to the char max) and will not be always stick to a fix value\r\n\r\nFeatures (long read):\r\n\r\nIf the attack lvl is equal to your opponents defense lvl then you will have an 85% block chance (70% was vanilla) , every +10 lvl diff you will get 5% extra block chance (10% vanilla) , every -10 lvl diff will lead to a penalizing -15% block chance. Also, if you are +10 attack levels higher you will have 1.75x more attacks than your opponent (1.5x vainilla). That will mean that if you are skilled enough, even outnumbered you can block most hits and get more hits also into the opponents. The max/min damage reduction has been increased to be more dependent on toughness , you can now deduct 85% of the max damage instead of 65% vanilla and the stumble damage is now 120 instead of 80 (vainilla). \r\nImmediate blood loss for cuts has been increased to 0.3 (0.2 vanilla) and now blunt weapons have 0.1 organ damage (0 vainilla), also , damage reduction is not fixed anymore (it is random up to the max/min).\r\n\r\nTo clarify a bit on blunt weapon organ internal damage:\r\n\r\nOrganDamage = BluntDamage * 0.1\r\nOrganStun = BluntDamage * (1 - 0.1)\r\n\r\nIt was a deactivated mechanic in the game (value=0) which I decided to re-activate, this made sense for blunt weapons, if you get hit by a big mace in the chest (IRL) you will notice the described effects.\r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n\r\n- All mods\r\n\r\nTo support my work and the time I spent feel free to donate to my PayPalMe.\r\n\r\n[url=paypal.me/nicolasmd87] [img]https://i.imgur.com/gmaqOA3.png[/img] [/url]\r\n\r\nI would reccomend donating to all mods you consider worth it, they are essentially free DLCs.\r\n\r\n[b]My other mods:[b]\r\n\r\nRebel Farmers Overhaul - Uprise against the UC (+new start as the Rebel Farmer Revolutionary):\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1890360942]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1890360942[/url]\r\n\r\nFort Simion Expanded:\r\n\r\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1897762637]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1897762637[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Please comment and rate !

    "description": "Trade, Items, and Trade Items Economy - Compatable edition\r\n\r\nBuilt on jbra1's Trade Routes Intensified( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1658170081 ), this mod attempts to make trade a bit more \"immerisive\" by adding weight to a handful of items to encourage pack animal use, tweaking jbra1'a modifiers down, and adding a few new items to give you a reason to visit regions that you might otherwise avoid.\r\n\r\nFirstly, if you prefer jbra1's more generous pricing, simply load Trade Routes Intensified lower than this mod in your load order. This mod does NOT require TRI, but I built the mod to work together because his is the the trade mod that's I've used the most and which seems to generally go in the direction I like. I will be working on a version of this mod that will be more 'stand-alone' since I've come to the conclusion that I don't actually like a bunch of trade modifiers everywhere and that I want to give many regions a unique item or two instead. \r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nAlright, what this mod does:\r\n\r\n1) Adds 4 new trade goods to the game,\r\n\r\nEles-Seeoh, from Mongrel. Mongrel doesn't have a lot going for it, but it's got an oil pump, so... Okranites call it the Bile of Narko so maybe don't go rolling into Blister Hill with a pack of this stuff.\r\n\r\nFish Oil. Most fish sellers have a chance of stocking some of this stuff, and in keeping with TRI's theme, the Shek like it. \r\n\r\nInfused Sake. Drifter's Last supplies this regional variation on the popular drink. \r\n\r\nSlave Filler. The Holy Nation allows some merchants to sell this cheap 'food' to traders. It's unsurprisingly not at all popular with anyone who cares about their food.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be much work to figure out who pays a premium on these items. A few of them might show up as items laying about in some places.\r\n\r\n2) Item weights. I don't like how you can carry an entire building in your backpack without much effort, so I greatly increased the weight of raw stone, raw iron, copper, building materials, iron plates, copper plates, and steel. They aren't so heavy as to be impossible to move, but they'll definitely train your strength for a while if you're in the habbit of filling packs up with rocks. A full load of building materials will weigh down a pack bull now, but that just gives you a reason to get more bulls. Or just make everyone carry bricks, I dunno.\r\n\r\n3) Price tweaks. I lowered TRI's price modifiers down to mostly 125%-150%. I left some high, usually items that can only be found or are justifiably rare or hard to get at those locations. Or if a 50% difference wouldn't make much difference anyway. I lowered Flotsam prices because they don't stay bottled up in nowhere forever, but they now pay increased prices for hemp, fabrics, building materials, and iron plates as they like to make their own stuff and are in a position to build. The holy nation now supplies parchment, skins, and meat at a discount since they have a strong ranch culture.\r\n\r\nAnd that's about it. This is mostly a personal mod project but I am thinking I may expand on the idea of regional items in the nearish future. Feedback is welcome, I've been playing with it a little while but I still might have missed some odd behavior. \r\n\r\nThe mod is pretty benign, and shouldn't conflict with anything. Mods that change vendors around a bit might result in these items popping up in weird places, but probably not.\r\n\r\nV.2 -> Reduces weights on materials and plates quite a bit, though raw iron, copper, water, oil,  and stone are still fairly hefty. High demand market for oil now pays 25% more (175%) to make account for such hostile territory. Certain crustacean-aligned groups now pay a bit more for fish oil, if you can sell to them.\r\n\r\nFixed slave trader prices for Slave Filler, I had missed that there's a 50% deduction on their merchants for everything. They should pay an extra 50% now. Mongrel now pays a small premium on Filler as well, as their food situation is supposedly tenuous.\r\n\r\nv3 -> Decreased oil weight down to 16kg a pop. It'll still weigh down a fully loaded pack for just about anyone but now one can fit a fair number on an adult pack animal before they get weighed down.",

    "description": "Did you know that hammerhead shark eyes are mounted on the sides because it allows 360° of vision in the vertical plane, meaning the animals can see above and below them at all times?\r\nWell then why do Hive Soldier Drones have NEGATIVE Perception??!?\r\n\r\nHive Soldiers are arguably the weakest race in the game, having 9 negative skills and only 2 positive skills. They also cannot wear helms making them vulnerable to Duststorms and Gas.\r\n\r\nThis mod aims to fix all of these problems, first with some stat tweaks and then with an added item available in Hive Villages. These changes apply to both Western and Southern Hive Soldiers.\r\n\r\nStat Tweaks:\r\n0% Perception changed from -20% Perception\r\n+20% Polearm changed from 0% Polearm\r\n100% Duststorm Immunity changed from 0% Duststorm Immunity\r\n1.4 Vision Range Multiplier changed from 1.0 Vision Range Multiplier\r\n\r\nNew Item:\r\nHive Soldier Gas Mask which can be equipped in the belt slot. Specifically designed for Hive Soldiers, it can only be worn by them. It provides 100% Weather Protection against Gas and it also has 5% head coverage, so you may get lucky and it can save your life! The resistance stats are identical to the Swamp Ninja Mask; details located in this wiki link: https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Swamp_Ninja_Mask\r\n\r\nThe Hive Soldier Gas Mask and blueprint are sold in Hive Villages. In case you are roleplaying an exiled Hiver that cannot return to the villages, the blueprint is also rarely sold at The Great Library in Black Scratch.\r\n\r\nBecause of their hammerhead like features, it made no sense to me that they'd have lesser Perception and I even contemplated buffing it, but since Hive Princes already get a bonus to Perception, I wanted Hive Soldiers to feel more unique. After much consideration a Polearm bonus made sense because that is literally what every Hive Soldier spawns equipped with.\r\n\r\nI decided that their unique head shape contributes to their ability to see in Duststorms (hence the 100% Immunity) and I also gave them a large vision range. This only effects NPCs and makes it much harder to run through Hiver terrority unseen. This is especially noticable when running through Southern Hiver territory as Soldier patrols will become aggressive from much further away. \r\n\r\nThis mod can be kept fairly high in load order as long as you don't have any other mods directly buffing Hive Soldiers. Even if you're using mods that heavily edit Western Hive Villages, you can always rely on buying the Gas Mask blueprint at The Great Library in Black Scratch, but since this mod adds the item to the vendor list, it should still show up in most cases. \r\n\r\nThis mod should be 100% compatible with Hives Expanded since the only edits to Hive Soldiers from Hives Expanded are the gear they spawn with. Hives Expanded is a great mod and I highly suggest giving it a try: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1688546539\r\n\r\nP.S. There are many mods that buff Hive Soldiers, but I've found the other mods do not do this in a lore friendly way. Why would Hivers suddenly become immune to Gas? I believe it is more lore friendly that Hivers would have invented a custom gas mask rather than suddenly become immune to Gas.\r\n\r\nIf you like my mod, feel free to hit that 👍\r\nPositive ratings help me know I'm doing a good job 😊\r\nI also appreciate positive feedback, feel free to leave a comment, or come chat with me live! I stream on Twitch, Tuesdays through Saturdays starting at 1PM EST!\r\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/2PercentNate\r\n\r\nMy workshop page featuring more of my Kenshi mods:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/2PercentNate/myworkshopfiles/?appid=233860",

If you accept they will wander around and do some shopping. \r\n\r\nThey do not join your faction but are more like passive occupants.\r\nAllowing them to join will give a boost (20) to your relationship with drifters.\r\n\r\nThey do not give you any benifit other than buying a little food, medicine, drugs and (hopefully) weapons. \r\n\r\nHowever they give your settlement a little life!\r\n\r\nIf you like this mod don't forget to give it a thumbs up\r\nand if you feel extra supportive buy me a coffee [ko-fi.com] :-)\r\n\r\nI still need to adjust the ai further it's not exactly what I want yet. \r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE CONFLICTS - In order for this mod to work I have changed the ruined town of Bast from United Cities to Drifters - so that they have an 'HQ'. This shouldnt affect any vanilla gameplay but may conflict with any mods that alter BAST.",

    "description": "This mod is a collection of various simple bug fixes that have yet to be implemented by the devs, and some tweaks to the game that in my opinion improve the experience. I've tried to avoid any major changes, but of course [i]major[/i] is subjective.\r\n\r\nThe list is relatively small right now, as it's just the things I thought of off the top of my head.

    "description": "Adds cats and string of cats to almost every character in the game, from Holy Nation Paladins to Empire Samurai, as well as Bandits, Swampers, Tech Hunters, Deadcats, Sheks, and many more. Also adds food to certain characters inventories, like farmers and bakers.\r\n\r\nAllows you to, essentially, take your fallen enemies coin purse when you're done with them. The money a character is holding tends to be based on their profession and their combat level, so expect traders to be wealthier than guards or bandits.\r\n\r\nAlso reduces the weight of cats and string of cats by a factor of 100, so rich characters aren't encumbered.",
